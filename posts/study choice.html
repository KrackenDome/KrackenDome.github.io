  <h1 id="h">Study choice</h1>
  <p id="lorem">After looking for a university that I liked, I found the HZ website and read through it, later on I  read through the HZ brochure and spoke with a consultant in education about whether or not the university will be good for me.<br>
    I chose this university because of its motto of “students come first” and I picked the ICT program to expand my horizons of knowledge and to challenge myself. I decided that after 5 years of ancient history, languages and cultures I wanted to learn more about the present and future, not only the past. In addition, it seems to be really interesting, and it can teach me more about the technical side of the software and programs I use.<br> I’ve always been interested in IT, mainly since a lot of my friends work in the field, I always wanted to learn more about everything software related, because it just seems so intriguing.
    After graduating I'd like to work as developer (or maybe a white hat) in a company. I want to do that because it seems like an interesting position to work in, but also, I want to save up enough money to go in to medical school and get a PhD so I can have more and different job opportunities in the future. In this study I expect to learn the ins and outs of programing, development, software engineering and several different programing languages that I could use in the future to create software that can be useful in the medical field, but also useful for the everyday person.
