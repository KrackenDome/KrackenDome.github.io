  <h1 id="h">First feedback</h1>
  <p id="lorem">My first feedback was by G.P. van den Abeele, the feedback itself made me think on my motivation, 
    my future once Iâ€™m done with this study and the future I want in to medicine, it made me realize that Ive never really 
    considered combining both medicine and ICT so I looked more in to that. Besides that the feedback was very nice, 
    eye opening and informative!

  <p>The feedback:<br>
    "Hey Vesper, welcome to the program! Good to hear your motivation for IT and this study. You talk about being interested in how software you use works. What else motivates you to persue a carreer in IT?

It seems like you also have thought a great deal about your future after this study. Keep in mind you will learn about many new subjects and job fields during this study so you will be able to make an even more informed choice after completing the study. 

You also mention wanting to persue a carreer in medical school. Since this is a completely different sector/study field I am curious about how you want to combine these two subjects. 

For your weaknesses in the SWOT -analysis you mention having trouble with communication with large amouns of people. I assume you mean presenting for groups. Just know you will be coached on this subject and also on other personal development subjects.

Just so you know. The questions I pose in the reply don't have to be answered here. Just think about the points mentioned because it will come back in future personal development courses and of course your first website.

Kind regards,

Gijs"
